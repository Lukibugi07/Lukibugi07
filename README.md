ESP32-BlueJammer - by @emensta
Jamming is ILLEGAL! Educational purposes only!

ESP32-BlueJammer
The ESP32-BlueJammer (Bluetooth jammer, BLE jammer, WiFi jammer, RC jammer) disrupts various devices using an ESP32 and nRF24 modules, causing plenty of noise and sending unnecessary packets (DoS).

It interrupts:
audio in speakers, smartphone connections, WiFi, RC Drones (etc.), IoT devices, and much more communicating on 2.4GHz!

Ideal for controlled disruption and security testing. Based on 2,4GHz communication.

It has a big range (over 30Meters+ - may vary on your antenna and hardware setup!) on newest Bluetooth versions with casual 2.4GHz antennas, you can easily increase this aswell by taking some simple "bigger" router antennas. An amplifier (2.4GHz) may be an good option too!

Remember that jamming is illegal and should not be used with malicious intent!


PCB's with ESP32 and RF-module capability 
DIY-PCB: "Blue ESP DIY PCB"
This PCB can fit an ESP32 DevKit and 2 RF-modules such as nRF24 or CC1101 etc., you can use it in combinations (1x nRF, 1x CC1101) to create several things.
Remember: It is not intended for illegal use, neither for my project!
For this one, all you need is listed below:

Required:

ESP32 Dev Module (such as ESP32-WROOM-32U, any ESP32 should work as long as it has the needed pins, 38P is recommended!)
nRF24L01+PA+LNA (2x)
Additional:

TP4056 Charging Module (Micro-USB/Type-C)
JST PH 2.0 Connector
3.7V Li-Ion Battery
3rd Antenna: IPEX to SMA-F pigtail
